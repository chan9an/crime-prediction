# Crime Data Analysis System  


A powerful crime data analysis tool designed to explore, visualize, and predict crime trends using Python and data science techniques.  

## Features  

- **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleans and structures raw crime data.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Provides insights into crime patterns, frequency, and trends.  
- **Geospatial Analysis** â€“ Maps crime hotspots using GIS tools.  
- **Predictive Modeling** â€“ Uses machine learning to forecast future crime trends.  
- **Interactive Visualizations** â€“ Generates charts and graphs for better understanding.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Folium   

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/chan9an/crime-prediction.git
   cd crime-data-analysis
   ```  

3. Run the project:  
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```  

## Usage  

1. Upload crime data in CSV format.  
2. Run analysis scripts to generate insights.  
3. Visualize data using built-in dashboards.  

## Dataset  
-Dataset is already provided in the repository.
- The project uses publicly available crime datasets. You can download them from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or government crime data portals.
